# NBA Stats API

This project is a backend RESTful API built with **Spring Boot** and connected to a **PostgreSQL** database. It provides structured access to NBA player statistics stored in the database, demonstrating key concepts of modern backend development.

## Overview

The NBA Stats API showcases a layered backend architecture with clear separation of concerns through the use of:

- **Entity models** for representing database tables  
- **Repositories** leveraging JPA for seamless object-relational mapping and data persistence  
- **Service layers** encapsulating business logic  
- **Controllers** managing HTTP requests and responses  

This design ensures maintainability, scalability, and clean code organization.

## Features

- CRUD operations for NBA player statistics  
- Robust integration between Spring Boot and PostgreSQL  
- Efficient data handling with JPA/Hibernate ORM  
- RESTful endpoints providing reliable access to data  

## Technologies Used

- Java with Spring Boot framework  
- PostgreSQL database  
- Spring Data JPA for ORM  
- RESTful API design principles
